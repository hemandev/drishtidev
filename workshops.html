                        the wired connections of your dream circuit ? Or make a reliable product without the curse of
                        "loose" connection?
                        Then look no further,my friend. Drishti'18 has got you covered.

                        Presenting a PCB Designing, Circuit Simulation and 3D printing workshop for the technocrats who
                        have a flair for complex circuit design.
                        You will learn how to design a PCB on EAGLE for your circuit - an invaluable skill that every
                        engineer must have.

                        Simulate your circuit on PROTEUS 8 to find out if it does actually work - no more burnt ICs!

                        Learn the basics of 3D printing on FUSION 360, because why not?

                        A power packed, 3-in-1 workshop that would be a crime to miss.
                        With a certificate issued by reputed organisations like FABLAB and ISTE , this one is a must for
                        the circuit lover inside you.
